# Battle.net Credentials Auto-Fill

**Description:**

Battle.net Auto-Fill is a tool that can manage and save your Battle.net accounts, easing the login process, especially if you have multiple accounts.

**How it works:**

The tool operates in the background. When you open Battle.net, the tool starts recording keystrokes. If a keyword is detected, it will automatically fill in the username and password for you.

You can store an unlimited number of accounts, each with its own unique keyword.
